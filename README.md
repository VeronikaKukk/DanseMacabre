# Dance Macabre

Card game with an AI opponent. The goal is to collect as many souls as possible by commiting your cards to piles. The player who was the highest bidder takes the pile. You can peak opponent's cards and play counter their plays.

Programmed by Veronika using Unity Engine. Art and sounds provided by Revaler.

For this project I made a card game system with custom AI. [Opponent AI](https://github.com/VeronikaKukk/DanseMacabre/blob/24e380652a0576a79adf5a456e6d78767d80c993/Assets/Scripts/AIController.cs) works by giving different scores to moves and choosing the best score.
